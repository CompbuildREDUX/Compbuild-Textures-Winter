# Compbuild-Textures-Winter
Changes the flora colors of Compbuild Textures to winter-like tundra-like colors for aesthetic purposes.

### Why does this exist?

Even though you can snow the place with WorldEdit and biomes, it's best meant to be used for screenshots and aesthetics rather than using it to help build.
